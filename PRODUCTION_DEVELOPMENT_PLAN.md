CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  role user_role NOT NULL,
  status user_status DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE escorts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  age INTEGER NOT NULL,
  bio TEXT,
  verification_status verification_status DEFAULT 'pending',
  status escort_status DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE bookings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  escort_id UUID REFERENCES escorts(id),
  client_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  time TIME NOT NULL,
  duration INTEGER NOT NULL,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  status booking_status DEFAULT 'pending',
